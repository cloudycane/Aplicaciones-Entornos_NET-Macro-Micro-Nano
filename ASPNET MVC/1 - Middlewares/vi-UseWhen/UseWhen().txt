In ASP.NET Core, `UseWhen()` is a powerful method that allows you to conditionally execute middleware only when a specific condition is met. This is particularly useful when you need to apply certain middleware logic for a subset of requests based on dynamic conditions, such as routes, headers, query strings, or other request data. It enables greater flexibility and avoids the performance overhead of always running middleware.

### Why is `UseWhen()` important in enterprise software development?

1. **Conditional Logic**:
   For enterprise applications, you may need to apply specific logic to certain types of requests or users (e.g., admin users vs. regular users, internal API calls vs. public ones). `UseWhen()` helps handle these scenarios by conditionally executing middleware only when the condition is true.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   By limiting middleware execution to certain requests, `UseWhen()` reduces unnecessary processing. This optimization is crucial in large-scale applications where performance is a priority, especially for consulting companies developing enterprise-grade solutions.

3. **Modularity**:
   It allows better modularity by keeping middleware logic cleaner and more separated. Instead of cluttering your middleware pipeline with multiple checks inside every middleware, you can conditionally run middleware only when it's needed.

### How `UseWhen()` works

`UseWhen()` takes two parameters:
- A predicate function that determines whether the middleware should be invoked.
- A middleware pipeline that will be executed if the predicate is `true`.

### Example Use Cases of `UseWhen()`

#### 1. **Different Middleware for API and Web Requests**:
   In an enterprise application, you might want to apply different middleware for API requests versus web requests. For example, an API might require special authentication, while web pages need different logging mechanisms.

   **Code Example**:
   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api"), apiApp =>
   {
       // This middleware will only run for API requests
       apiApp.UseMiddleware<ApiAuthenticationMiddleware>();
       apiApp.UseMiddleware<ApiLoggingMiddleware>();
   });

   app.UseWhen(context => !context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api"), webApp =>
   {
       // This middleware will only run for non-API (web) requests
       webApp.UseMiddleware<WebRequestLoggingMiddleware>();
   });
   ```

#### 2. **Custom Logic Based on Query String**:
   You could use `UseWhen()` to apply special logging or other middleware when a request contains a specific query string parameter, such as `?admin=true`. This might be useful when certain features are accessible only to administrators or for debugging.

   **Code Example**:
   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("admin"), adminApp =>
   {
       // Run admin-specific middleware for requests with ?admin=true
       adminApp.UseMiddleware<AdminMiddleware>();
   });
   ```

#### 3. **Conditional Response Compression**:
   An enterprise application might want to enable response compression only for certain endpoints (e.g., APIs), while skipping it for others (e.g., large file uploads).

   **Code Example**:
   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api"), apiApp =>
   {
       // Enable response compression for API requests
       apiApp.UseResponseCompression();
   });
   ```

#### 4. **Role-Based Middleware**:
   In a multi-tenant enterprise system, `UseWhen()` can conditionally apply middleware based on user roles or specific claims. For example, certain features might only be available to users with an "Admin" role.

   **Code Example**:
   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.User.IsInRole("Admin"), adminApp =>
   {
       // Only run middleware for users in the Admin role
       adminApp.UseMiddleware<AdminOnlyMiddleware>();
   });
   ```

### Real-World Scenarios in Consulting Companies

1. **API Versioning**:
   A consulting company building a large-scale API for an enterprise client may need to handle multiple API versions. `UseWhen()` can help direct requests to different middleware pipelines based on API versioning.

   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api/v2"), v2App =>
   {
       // Apply version 2 specific middleware
       v2App.UseMiddleware<ApiV2Middleware>();
   });
   ```

2. **Geolocation-Based Response**:
   For a global enterprise system, you may want to apply middleware conditionally based on the user's region or IP address. `UseWhen()` could trigger middleware that serves localized content or handles GDPR compliance.

   ```csharp
   app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Headers["X-Region"] == "EU", euApp =>
   {
       // Apply GDPR compliance middleware only for EU region
       euApp.UseMiddleware<GdprMiddleware>();
   });
   ```

### Conclusion

In enterprise software development, especially in consulting companies, `UseWhen()` is highly valuable for improving performance, scalability, and flexibility. It allows developers to apply middleware selectively, ensuring that the right logic is executed under the right circumstances without adding unnecessary overhead to other parts of the application.
